title: Freelance PHP developer, the return!!

For those of you that don't know, I've been working for CleverCherry for the last year (well, a year as of yesterday). It has been a wonderful year and a wonderful experience. I've made some friends along the way and I've thoroughly enjoyed being a part of their team. I handed my notice in some two months ago and my final day of employment will be the 3rd November, followed by a week of me relaxing, and then it's back into it again."

It has only been a year, but I’m making a return to the world of freelancing.

For those of you that don’t know, I’ve been working for [CleverCherry](http://clevercherry.com) for the last year (well, a year as of yesterday). It has been a wonderful year and a wonderful experience. I’ve made some friends along the way and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed being a part of their team. I handed my notice in some two months ago and my final day of employment will be the 3rd November, followed by a week of me relaxing, and then it’s back into it again.

The reason for my decision to return to the world of freelancing is that in all honesty, I miss it. After four years of being my own boss it’s hard to get used to situations where I don’t have the say, and for those that know me, I have a problem with that most the time as it is. On top of that, I miss the sort of work I did when I was in London. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve worked on some really interesting things while with CleverCherry, but I’ve always been a fan of functionality driven applications.

As of the 13th of November I will be available for freelance projects and contracts alike. I’m also, as always, open to employment should an opportunity turn up on my desk that I absolutely cannot turn down. If you’re looking for a freelance developer to build your app, or a contractor to bolster your team, get in touch over at [Ollie’s Lab](https://ollieslab.io).

On a side note, this hopefully means that I’ll have time to actually write articles and work on some of my open source projects!!!
